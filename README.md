# baseball

This project began with a research question from a friend - how well do older players perform in baseball? To answer the question, I pulled data from MLB's Baseball Savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/).

First, I visualized some of the data with Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn. Next, I used some of SKLearn's libraries to do Principal Component Analysis and Clustering, which created profiles of player seasons. 

I visualized those results and used them to draw a conclusion.
